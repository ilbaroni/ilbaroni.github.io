MMON (aka KAPTOXA) is a command-line tool to find credit card data and other patterns within a process memory address space.



Sample:

```

PDB: P:\vm\devel\dark\mmon\Release\mmon.pdb
```



Available command-line options:

To search the process memory, MMON uses a combination of **OpenProcess**, **VirtualQueryEx**, **ReadProcessMemory**.

The CC tracks are validated with the Luhn algorithm:

As seen below, MMON was able to find the dummy CC tracks within the notepad process memory:
